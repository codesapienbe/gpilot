Project Proposal:

Project Title: Robot Playing Game with OpenCV and MediaPipe

Objective: The main objective of this project is to create a robot which can play a game without any human interaction. The robot will use Raspberry Pi 4 as its board, OpenCV for object recognition, and MediaPipe for controlling mouse and keyboard. It will also use the “gymnasium” python package to help the robot learn how to play games. The first game that the robot will attempt to play is Doom. 

Scope: The scope of this project is to create a robot that can play a game without requiring any installation or bridge connection to the game itself. The robot must be able to recognize objects, opponents, etc in the game using OpenCV and control the mouse and keyboard remotely using MediaPipe. The robot must not be used as a game hack or anything like that. 

Deliverables:
- A robot which can play a game without any human interaction
- Object recognition using OpenCV
- Controlling mouse and keyboard remotely using MediaPipe
- Learning to play the game using “gymnasium” python package

Timeline:
Phase 1 - Research and Analysis (2 weeks)
Phase 2 - Design and Development (4 weeks)
Phase 3 - Testing and Debugging (2 weeks)
Phase 4 - Deployment (1 week)

Risks:
- Incorrect object recognition by OpenCV
- Difficulty in controlling mouse and keyboard remotely
- Inability to learn how to play the game from “gymnasium” python package
